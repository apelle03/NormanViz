1. Show the current dataset name
2. In the graph, when grouping things, sort the list of testnames in the

4. When nodes in the graph overlap, make sure we can select the smaller one.
5. The new data set crashes.
6. When hovering over students, be able to click to "lock in" the selected
student. Same thing when hovering over a node.

8. Try putting the dual data into the visualization
