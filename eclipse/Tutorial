# Tutorial

## Loading Data

Open a dataset with the "Open a dataset..." button in the middle of the screen.

After a dataset is open, change the dataset with the "Change the dataset..." 
button in the upper left corner.

## Sections

There's three coordinated views:

- Students: Shows list of students. Useful for seeing how particular people's 
  data factors into the overall equation.
- Test sets: Shows relationships between sets of tests with the same group of 
  students that passed/failed.
- Result sets: Shows which witnesses were most common for a given test.

There's coordination via hovering:

- Hover over students to see the test sets they passed.
- Hover over test sets to see the students that passed/failed them.
- Hover over bubbles in the test sets to see what tests are in them.
- Hover over bars in the result sets to see what witness they represent.

If you are unsure how to use the application, click "Help" in the upper right corner.

The program generally doesn't work well with invalid data files.

## Graph Controls

There are a number of sliders on the top of the network graph view.
Tinker around with all of them to see what makes it work and not work:

- Spring: Changes force of springs representing edges.
- Spring Length: Changes normal length of springs for edges.
- Repulsion: Amount of force to separate nodes with.
- Gravity: Amount of force pulling the graph over to the side to 
  straighten things out.
