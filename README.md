Golfing-Velociraptors
=====================

This is our Computer Visualization final project. It was created by Eliot Alter,
Andrew Pellegrini, and Jonathan Wilde for the Computer Visualizations class at
Tufts University. It visualizes the Comp 40 dataset of test cases and their
various outcomes/witnesses and mapped them to an interactive visualization. 

Running the code
================
We used eclipse to develop the code. If you don't have eclipse, you can either
run the ``javac`` with all of the ``.java`` files. For convenience, a
.jar file will be provided.

Interesting things that we found
================================
See the Scenario file.
